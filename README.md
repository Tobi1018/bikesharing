## Project Overview 

For this analysis, I used Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, created a set of visualizations to:

* Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
* Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week.
* Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Deliverable 1
Using Python and Pandas functions, converted the "trip-duration" column from an integer to a DateTime data type to get the time in hours, minutes, and seconds (00:00:00). After converting the "trip duration" column to a DateTime data type, then export the DataFrame as a CSV file to use for the trip analysis in Deliverable 2.

## Deliverable 2

Used Tableau to create visualizations that shows;

* How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
* How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders?
* A breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender.




For this visualization, the time frame during which bikes are being checked out by all riders was analyzed.

The following visualization shows the length of time that bikes are checked out per gender.

In this visualization, it shows the number of bike trips by weekday for each hour of the day as a heatmap.
